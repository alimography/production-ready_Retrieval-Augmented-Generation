# production-ready_Retrieval-Augmented-Generation

📌 Project Description (Keyword-Optimized)

Developed a production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using FastAPI, LangChain, and Redis Queue (RQ) to handle asynchronous, non-blocking LLM query processing. Implemented RESTful APIs that enqueue user queries for background job execution, enabling scalable and fault-tolerant backend architecture. The system performs semantic search and context-aware question answering using vector embeddings and LLM inference pipelines, with modular Python packaging and distributed worker processes. Applied production debugging, worker process management, and  demonstrating real-world GenAI backend engineering and microservices-oriented design.
